          <h2 class="green-text">Enterprise’s Name</h2>
          <p>
            "eStuff!" is the name for my enterprise. The reason I choose that name is because it stands for a mantra “easily (to) exchange stuff”. Nowadays, if people want to look for something on the internet, they say Google it because the word “Google” has become a verb for a long time. I really want to make eStuff! to be a verb too, so people will say eStuff! something and use my product instead of saying: I want to exchange thing but I have no idea what to do next.
          </p>
          <h2 class="green-text">Industry Center</h2>
          <p>
            The industry center sector that my enterprise fall into is Specialty Retail.
          </p>
          <h2 class="green-text">Context</h2>
          <p>
            When I was in high school, I worked for a mobile sale agent to sell latest smartphones and electronic devices. In my free time, I was going online buying and selling stuff because that time I was so obsessed with technology that I wanted to own every device I could reach. 3 years of doing so gave me a valuable understanding of Vietnam e-commerce. I noticed that there was a smart way that people didn’t have to buy news things to own ones. For example:
            I had an iPhone 5 and I wanted an iPhone 6. Someone might have an iPhone 6 and wanted to downgrade to iPhone 5 for some reasons. I could totally contact him and exchanged our devices. I could give him 100$ to have an iPhone 6 instead of 1000$ to buy a new one.
          </p>
          <h3 class="green-text">An example of systems that requires Administrator permission</h3>
          <p>
            <a class="blue-text blue-underlined" href="https://nhattao.com/">https://nhattao.com/</a> is a forum that I usually went there to buy, sell and exchange stuff when I was in Vietnam. It was easy for me to write a post saying that I wanted to buy an iPhone 6 or I wanted to sell an iPhone 5. But if I wanted to say that I want to exchange my iPhone 5 with an iPhone 6, I had to say that the purpose of this post was not to buy or sell anything, I wanted to exchange things only so please don’t delete my post. Another good examples are Amazon and eBay, I can only buy things or if I am registered as a buyer, I can only sell thing. Of course I can say that I have something and ask for whom want to exchange with me but that’s not Amazon and eBay is built for. They have professional buyers and sellers who want to make money, not to exchange values like what I am trying to do.
          </p>
          <h2 class="green-text">Problem</h2>
          <p>
            Because all the online marketplace at the moment are for buying and selling, there aren’t any site that let people exchange things easily. They don’t let you write any post for exchanging purpose or they will let you if you ask for permission. Even if you do that, it’s not effective because you have to find the other people who want your things and also want to exchange thing with you. It takes a lot of time and effort to make a final deal.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is actually my own problem. It is hard to me to exchange that way even though I have exchanged successfully a lot of deals. The more I do that, the more I notice that there is a lot of people that have the same problem like me. If can fix my problem, I can help other people the same way and I can start a company out of that idea to help more and more people.
          </p>
          <h2 class="green-text">Solution</h2>
          <p>
            I want to make a platform that people can go there and exchange stuff easily. Let’s reuse the previous example that I have an iPhone 5 and want an iPhone 6:
          </p>
          <p>
            First, I will go to eStuff! website, sign up with Facebook account with just one click.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are 3 reasons I use Facebook. First is security. Facebook works hard to ensure that their users use their real identities on Facebook, preventing them from scam or fraud. I can use that advantage to ensure the security on my site. Second is information. When people use Facebook to sign up for my site, I automatically have their Facebook profiles that contains a lot of helpful information then I can take advantage of Facebook close community for developing idea, feedback, marketing strategies,… Third is popularity. More and more people own a Facebook account, so if they want to use my product, they don’t have to struggling with signing up an account, they can use Facebook instead. This saves a huge amount of time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Second, a real time list of people who want to exchange thing is appeared. I will scroll down to see if there are any interesting things to exchange. If not, I will begin a new post.
          </p>
          <p>
            Third, a survey is appeared. I will type in that I have an iPhone 5, 95% like new, 250$ predicted price and a note that every function works perfectly fine. After that, I will tell the system I want an iPhone 6, like new from 90% to 100%, price range from $250 to 500$.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fourth, I click “Search” button and the system will do the work. It will match me with a list of people that have an iPhone 6 that have specific needs I want to. I can choose to see their pictures and message them to meet and exchange.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fifth, I find out that a person name Bill has a beautiful black iPhone 6 that looks really nice in pictures and his price is $350. I contact him and after some conversation, he agrees to exchange. At the end, I will give him my iPhone 5 plus $100 and he gives me his iPhone 6. Problem solved.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here is the demo website that I made 4 months ago. It’s just a simple prototype to show how eStuff! work and how it will display the result. It doesn’t work exactly like the solution above (because it’s just a prototype) but the search function is works well for presentation. https://estuff.herokuapp.com/
          </p>
          <h2 class="green-text">Competitors</h2>
          <p>
            I believe my competitors will be Amazon, eBay, and Craigslist but the one that I am afraid the most is Facebook.
          </p>
          <p>
            As of the third quarter of 2016, Facebook had 1.79 billion monthly active users. It just released Marketplace that allows people to buy and sell things. They can use Marketplace to list what they have and what they want within their groups of friends, networks, or other network. Since, the number one problem in online shopping is trust, Facebook solves that problem nicely because they let people make deal in a group connection that they’ve already known and believed. 12 years ago when Facebook came out, the defining factor set Facebook aside from the rest of social media channels then to become the most successful one was the algorithm to create a close-knit connection between people, strengthen their relationship, encourage them to interact actively and attract more people to join their close community. Facebook now use their advantage of this close local community to encourage transaction among people. It will definitely take e-commerce to the next level.
          </p>
          <p>
            Besides that, big companies like Amazon, eBay, Craigslist and Facebook can possibly copy our feature in the future to implement on their product. With their brand name, capital, distribution count, they will take away our market overnight. This is a really big problem that we have to care from the beginning. However, the fact is that big companies can develop technology but they cannot do it quickly. Therefore, we will focus on that weakness and develop our technology as fast as possible and focus on hard technical problem.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another option for big companies is to buy us and bring our development team to work on their projects. Unfortunately, the hardest thing for them is to act (I mean actually making decision to buy us). Hence, in this option, we still have to grow rapidly and show them our enterprise cost much more than their offers. Or if we’re good enough, we might make big companies compete each other to buy us!
          </p>
          <p>
            I will talk more about why would my project be hard for someone else to duplicate in the Proprietary Technology section.
          </p>
          <h2 class="green-text">Market Size</h2>
          <p>
            According to the 2015 October 9th Forbes article, the market capitalization of Amazon is 249.1 billions and eBay is 31.1 billions. There are 157 million active buyers on eBay and that generate revenue of $8644 million. I want to focus more on the eBay’s capital because its business model is still marketplace and Amazon is a mix of retailer and marketplace.
          </p>
          <h2 class="green-text">Market Characterization</h2>
          <p>
            My industry is very competitive but eStuff! only focus on a niche market: people who love online shopping that want to exchange things instead of buying new ones.
          </p>
          <p>
            eStuff! also allocates people with an older device in good shape with an opportunity to use the value in that asset and exchange it with another trader for something they would like.  eStuff! unlocks the value of inherent value of an object and outs it to work for you.
          </p>
          <h3 class="green-text">Demographics in the first 3 years: Age 15-30</h3>
          <p>
            Because the original idea of my enterprise came from when I was a student in high school and I saw a lot of problems came from students like me that had no income or little income.
            Therefore, I want to market to student in the middle of secondary school to college students, grad school till the age of 30.
          </p>
          <h3 class="green-text">Why limit the size of your market by limiting the age of the participants?  Isn’t it likely that older customers (30+) would have more assets to exchange? </h3>
          <p>
            It's true. However, in the first 3 years, we want to focus more on the young customers because they are more open-minded, adventurous than older ones. Also, they adapt with new technology more quickly. Growth is one of the most important factor for small startup like us so we really want to focus on the younger generations, have a solid base, grow fast and keep a small feedback loop. After that, we will market to the older customers and get more capital as you have said that they would have more assets to exchange. However, we will be flexible and definitely market to the older while focusing in the younger and if it’s work out well, we will change our plan to broaden the demographics.
          </p>
          <h2 class="green-text">Traction</h2>
          <p>
            My platform is free for everybody but charge a small fee on each transaction. The problem is, I don’t think we are going to make money in the first 2 years because our platform is not trusted enough for people that will to pay fee. That’s why we need to focus heavily on the customers and security.
          </p>
          <p>
            We use Facebook to improve our security level so people would definitely have more trust. Second, we can use other security companies’s online payment method so we don’t have to worry about payments anymore. Therefore, the real “trust” problem here is not about technical things like our products and online payments because that can be solved easily with third-party companies, but it is about how to get more users to trust in other people so they are not hesitate to do transactions with each other. In the end, it all comes down to users because they’re are the reason our enterprise survive. My strategy here is to focus on the customer service. We would rather have 100 quality customers than 1000 random customers. We want to deliver the best experience for users, beyond their expectations.
          </p>
          <h2 class="green-text">Proprietary Technology</h2>
          <p>
            This is the best time to answer the question “Why would your project be hard for someone else to duplicate?”
          </p>
          <p>
            The idea requires executing well in 2 direction: online marketplace and social media. We want to create an environment for people to exchange thing easily and we do it in a way that other social media platform do. It’s easy for people to write a post and include their photos and video. Other can comment on their posts, or message them directly. They can also call or video-call each other. We will have a feature to “love” as Instagram, “pin” to see the deal every time they log in, and save to their wishlist. Although building a successful social media application itself is hard, we want to combine that with our vision of an “exchanging” online marketplace to maximize the potential.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another thing is hard to do is to change the habits of people. Because it’s a mindset of people that they will go online and shop for new things. eStuff! is the opposite. You have old things and want to exchange with new things. It’s a big challenge for us to change the habits of people that focus on the value of old stuff instead of the price and the brand-new looking because at the end of the day, we want to do with our things, we want it to be functional and solve our problem. That’s the main the reason we buy something.
          </p>
          <h2 class="green-text">Business Model</h2>
          <p>
            My platform is free for everybody but charge a small fee on each transaction. Also, we provide advertising options for businesses.
          </p>
          <p>
            Subscription based only work for product that is day life’s essential and everyday use everyday like music streaming, video streaming, or newspapers. Because we run it like a social media platform so it should be free for anyone. However, to do transaction, they might need to charge us some fee like 2%. Also, we provide shipping option for people that far away from each other and charge the shipping costs.
            I will make deal with business to make money from advertisement. People now have an option to exchange with business to get better deal (with less price) than buying a brand-new one.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, if Apple has an program to exchange old phones: iPhone 6 with iPhone 7. Normally,  they will release the program on their own. However, our site has a lot of potential users that have many old stuff to exchange, Apple might want to make a deal with us to show their ads. It’s beneficial in both way because they Apple will reach more users and users will have better discount.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will have a ranking system to define how trustworthy an account is. If a person’s account has more trust, one will get better deal with business (more discount) or one will have discount on the transaction’s fee or shipping fee.
          </p>
          <p>
            In short, most of the income will come from ad.
          </p>
          <h2 class="green-text">Market Adoption</h2>
          <p>
            What I am going to do first is to advertise in my network connections. Since I have been in Vietnamese e-commerce for 3 years, I have some connections that I can rely on. After that, I will go to nhattao.com – a forum that I always go to when I need to exchange some things, advertise my product there. I will talk with their company and cooperate to offer our service. In the first year, I want to focus on nhattao.com because the people there has very high rates for exchange things. In second year, we will begin to advertise on Facebook, target technology geeks first and relations on nhattao.com
          </p>
          <p>
            I did not say in the first place that the plan above was only worked when I launched my product in Vietnam. Since I will launch it in the US, I am thinking about using Facebook as the main source for marketing. Also, we wants to get users from Amazon, eBay and Craigslist so we are definitely run campaigns on their sites.  Sometimes, we can give talks and create events for people who want to talk about their experience with our products and use that to make viral marketing contents.
          </p>
          <h2 class="green-text">Founding Team</h2>
          <p>

          </p>
          <h2 class="green-text">Use of Funds</h2>
          <p>
            Because the main cost in software startup is people, I will use most of the funds to growth my development team, including engineers, customer service and sales team.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the first year, 2-3 people is ideal. This time we spend most of the time building our system and test on specific, familiar target to get a small feedback loop.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the second year, we want to hire more 2-3 exceptional engineers to maintain and secure technical things and 2-3 people to do good customer service. We want more users at this time and to earn more capital.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Year 3, we want to hire 2-3 people to do operation and finance. This stage is really important because we are trying to scale as fast as possible. We need to take care of our customers carefully while take advantages of them to acquire more users.
          </p>
          <p>
            We absolutely release our MVP (Minimum viable product) version in Year 1. It’s not a beta or a prototype but a first version working product. Also, what I mean by “testing” here is not about testing the beta version anymore but we still apply the testing process on our official product. I know that you have heard it before because we are following “lean startup” method, which basically means that we launch the MVP product as fast as possible, get feedback, improve and keep doing that within a small loop.
          </p>
          <p>
            We want it to be small because we have small and we have to spend wisely on great people.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the most common reason that kill startup is spending money on the wrong things. We want to spend mostly on development team and marketing to get users.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here is how we save money:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>We can live cheaply in someone’s house to save money on office, furniture, HVAC. </li>
            <li>We spend some money on high speed internet, servers and phones and on travel if it’s necessary.</li>
            <li>All of us have computers and we can totally use that because our work doesn’t require any fancy machines.</li>
            <li>We do everything digitally so we don’t need printers or business card (we can use electronic business card)</li>
          </ul>
