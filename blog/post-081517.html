          <h2 class="green-text">First thing first,</h2>
          <p>
            I have been lifting and coding for almost 1 year now. I started both of them around the same time and it was also the first time I attempted to do so. Therefore, I'm still a complete beginner.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have learnt a lot from lifting alone to improve my strength and personal record. Interestingly, these lessons can apply well for improving coding skills, especially in learning Computer Science.
          </p>
          <h2 class="green-text">A solid foundation is crucial.</h2>
          <p>
            It was in the end of 2017 Spring term, I did not go to the gym for 2 weeks. I said to myself I was busy and it was fine to rest for a while and focus on studying. Everything was good until 2 week later. I could hardly pick up the same weight as I could before. I had to decrease 10% to 20% of the weight but it was still a challenge.
          </p>
          <p>
            Later on, I found out that I did not have a solid strength base. I thought I was strong but I was not. If my strength base was solid, I could totally lift the same weight I was able to lift at least 95% of the weight I was able to lift before.
          </p>
          <p>
            That said, it’s very easy to forget about how does quick sort work if you don’t have a strong knowledge on Data Structure and Algorithm.
          </p>
          <h2 class="green-text">It all comes down to the basics. </h2>
          <p>
            In strength training, there are 3 most important movements: Bench Press, Squat, and Deadlift. If you look at different bodybuilding programs or powerlifting programs, you would always see that they are the core movements.
          </p>
          <p>
            They are all compounds movements which target different muscle groups at the same time. You not only train your chest by doing Bench Press but also your arm, your shower, your back. It is proved by many great couch that doing barbell exercises is the most simplest and effective way to get stronger and build muscle. There are hundreds of exercises that you can do but if you are not doing well with these main movements, it’s hard to gain well and effectively.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, back to computer science education. The main reason that we need to study computer science in the first place is because it is the foundation and basics that everyone who want to be a great software engineer should know. Just like the 3 big movements, in Computer Science we have: Data Structure and Algorithms, Computer Architecture, Operating Systems, Computer Networking, Compilers, Databases.
          </p>
          <p>
            The one who understand computer science well enough is able to do challenging, innovative work. The one who don’t typically stay at the surface, learning specific tools and technologies rather than their underlying foundations, only picking up new skills when the winds of technical fashion change.
          </p>
          <h2 class="green-text">Train with high volume and frequency, low intensity. Slowly progress overtime.</h2>
          <p>
            This is one of the most important lesson that I learn in order to build a solid strength base and to hit a personal record. It’s physically impossible to add 5 pounds to the workout every week because you will hit a plateau eventually. So how can you still increase the weight? The short answer is to train in your 70-80% of your 1 rep max, lower the intensity, higher the volume, slowly add weight over time and repeat.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, you train 70% the weight in your first week. Next week, you increase the weight to 72,5% and continue to add 2,5% in the next few weeks. After 4 weeks, you measure your 1 rep max again and repeat the cycle at 72.5%.
          </p>
          <p>
            It really depends on the individual but the key point is to lower the intensity to achieve high volume and increase slowly overtime. The reason you want to do that is because you want to drill down the technique. You want to increase your strength base which will help your potential gain. Instead of chasing a personal record, focus on the big picture, which is to improve your overall strength then eventually you will hit a new personal record.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Computer Science, you want to do the easy problems, increase difficulty and repeat after a while.
            Also, instead of practicing 3 times a week, practice everyday!
          </p>
          <h2 class="green-text">Supporting exercises, variations help. </h2>
          <p>
            Let’s say you are stuck at Bench Pressing 200 pounds for months. One thing you might consider is to try out different variations or supporting exercises like Dumbbell Press or Dips. The Floor Press focuses more on explosive strength and targets more on your arm and the Incline Barbell Press targets more on your upper chest. Find your weakness and improve constantly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Try different sorting algorithms if you’re stuck at a particular one.
          </p>
          <h2 class="green-text">That’s it. That’s all I have to say!</h2>
